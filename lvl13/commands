# We have a binary file, let's try to execute it
# UID 2013 started us but we we expect 4242, we have this error message.
# We then need to find a way to start our program with the correct UID
# Let's use gdb to check what's going on
	gdb level13
	disas main
# We can see a call of the cmp function which probably compare our UID to the given one in the main (4242)
# This is where we need to change the UID so we can launch our program with the 4242 UID
# Let's check on the internet the hexa for 4242 -> 0x1092
# Let's set a breakpoint to the cmp call so we can change eax register value
	b * *0x0804859a
	run
# We need to set eax register to 4242 value in hexa
	set %eax=0x1092
	continue
